# Main DDR (Detailed Diagnostic Report)

## 1. Property Issue Summary
- Roof terrace shows damp patches near the north parapet and visible seepage marks.
- Ceiling in bedroom has water stains and minor paint blistering.
- Bathroom wall has mold growth behind the shower mixer.
- Area: Roof terrace north edge recorded 38.6 C hotspot at 11:00 AM.
- Thermal interpretation suggests trapped moisture in slab and wall interface.
- Recommend moisture meter validation and post-repair thermal retest.

## 3. Area-wise Observations
### Ceiling
- [Inspection Report] Ceiling in bedroom has water stains and minor paint blistering.
### General
- [Inspection Report] No structural crack observed in internal columns.
- [Thermal Report] Recommend moisture meter validation and post-repair thermal retest.
### Roof
- [Inspection Report] Roof terrace shows damp patches near the north parapet and visible seepage marks.
- [Inspection Report] Possible cause: rainwater entering through failed terrace waterproofing joints.
- [Thermal Report] Area: Roof terrace north edge recorded 38.6 C hotspot at 11:00 AM.
### Terrace
- [Inspection Report] Recommend re-sealing terrace joints and checking drainage slope.
- [Thermal Report] Area: Bedroom ceiling recorded 24.1 C cooler patch below terrace slab.
### Wall
- [Inspection Report] Bathroom wall has mold growth behind the shower mixer.
- [Thermal Report] Area: Bathroom wet wall recorded 27.8 C with irregular thermal anomaly.
- [Thermal Report] Thermal interpretation suggests trapped moisture in slab and wall interface.

## 4. Probable Root Cause
- Possible cause: rainwater entering through failed terrace waterproofing joints.

## 5. Severity Assessment (with reasoning)
- Severity Level: High
- Reasoning: Structural crack appears with moisture indicators; escalation advised.

## 6. Recommended Actions
- Recommend re-sealing terrace joints and checking drainage slope.
- Recommend moisture meter validation and post-repair thermal retest.
